# project

practice socket.io.

## Concept

I used the API from musixmatch.com to get lyrics and track details. My plan as of right now, is to present the user with a piece of lyric of an unknown random track. The idea is to guess the next word or guess the genre. Whatever is more compatible with the data I have.

The real time aspect is to do this with multiple users in a room, to make it a battle.
