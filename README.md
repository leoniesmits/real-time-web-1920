# Lyric guessing game

<p align="center"><b>Battle your friend in lyric-knowledge. Choose a decade, load songs and guess lyrics.</p></b>

![preview](github/screen.png)
_This is what the screen should have looked like._

## Introduction
This project was an assignment of [@cmda-minor-web](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/real-time-web-1920). The goal of this course was to create a real time app based on [sockets](https://socket.io/). 

I used the API from musixmatch.com to get lyrics and track details. My plan is to present the user with a piece of lyric of an unknown random track. There are 4 track titles loaded, the user has to guess to which the lyrics belong.

The real time aspect is to do this with multiple users in a room, to make it a battle.
