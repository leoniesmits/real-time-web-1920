# Lyric guessing game

<p align="center"><b>Battle your friend in lyric-knowledge. Choose a decade, load songs and guess lyrics.</p></b>

![preview](github/screen.png)
_This is what the screen should have looked like._

## Introduction
This project was an assignment of [@cmda-minor-web](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/real-time-web-1920). The goal of this course was to create a real time app based on [sockets](https://socket.io/). 

I used the API from musixmatch.com to get lyrics and track details. My plan is to present the user with a piece of lyric of an unknown random track. There are 4 track titles loaded, the user has to guess to which the lyrics belong.

The real time aspect is to do this with multiple users in a room, to make it a battle.

### Getting data

Originally I was going to get song data from Spotify, but OAuth was giving me a hard time. After some sad attempts to get some data, [Kris](https://github.com/kriskuiper) helped me and now I have some data from spotify locally stored. 

This local data, found under `data/playlists` are some JSON files containing detailed metadata. This data is later connected to my API fetch 

```
const getTrackLyrics = function (obj) {
    const title = obj.song;
    const artist = obj.artists[0];
    const url = 'https://api.musixmatch.com/ws/1.1/matcher.lyrics.get?' +
        querystring.stringify({
            format: 'json',
            apikey: api_key
        });
    return axios.get(url).then(res => {
        if (res.status === 200 && 
            res.data.message.body && 
            res.data.message.body.lyrics) {
                return res.data.message.body.lyrics.lyrics_body;
            }
        else {
            return false;
        }
    }).catch(err => {
        return err;
    });
};
```

This should give me tracks of the Musixmatch API, but doesn't seem to work anymore.
